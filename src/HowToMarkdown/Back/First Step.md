# Naker Back Viewer
#### A standalone library to add 3D backgrounds on your website

## Getting Started

Import the Javascript Back Viewer in the header of your website :

```html
<script data-who='ðŸ’Ž Made with naker.io ðŸ’Ž' src='https://d23jutsnau9x47.cloudfront.net/back/v1.0.3/viewer.js' ></script>
```

This line will import the `nakerback` global variable to your website.

## Usage

You then need to choose the html element which will be used to draw the background. You can just select this node by its `id` like this :
```javascript
var container = document.getElementById('container');
```

Use the render function of the viewer and your background options in order to automatically create your 3D illustration like so :

```javascript
nakerback.render({
  container: document.getElementById('container'),
});
```

## Options
You must also add some options to the render function.
Type rgbArray:[r, g, b] and Vector3:{x:_number_, y:_number_, z:_number_}

### Particle

| Name           | Type            | Description                                    |
| :------------- | :----------:    | -----------------------------------------------|
| texture        | _string_        | The texture of particles                       |
| number         | _number_        | The number of particle to draw                 |
| colorStart     | _rgbArray_      | Color of particle when it appears              |
| colorEnd       | _rgbArray_      | Color of particle when it desappears           |
| sizeStart      | _number_        | Size of particle when it appears               |
| sizeEnd        | _number_        | Size of particle when it desappears            |
| life           | _number_        | Size of particle when it desappears            |
| power          | _number_        | Movement power of particle when it appears     |
| direction1     | _Vector3_       | Direction of the particle when it appears      |
| direction2     | _Vector3_       | Second direction of the particle when it appears |

### Environment

| Name           | Type            | Description                                    |
| :------------- | :----------:    | -----------------------------------------------|
| sensitivity    | _number_        | Sensitivity of the camera when the mouse move  |
| colorStart     | _rgbArray_      | Color of the top background                    |
| colorEnd       | _rgbArray_      | Color of the top background                    |
| gradient       | 'horizontal', 'vertical' or 'radial' | The way the gradient is drawn   |

### Result
At the end your render function will work like this:
```javascript
nakerback.render({
    container: document.getElementById('container'),
    particle: {
        direction1: {x:0,y:0,z:0},
        direction2: {x:0,y:0,z:0},
        life: 5.3,
        power: 0.5,
        texture: "https://res.cloudinary.com/naker-io/image/upload/v1566560053/circle_02.png",
        number: 0,
        colorStart: [89,173,220,0.63],
        colorEnd: [198,199,230,0.87],
        sizeStart: 2,
        sizeEnd: 4
    },
    environment: {
        sensitivity: 0.96,
        colorStart: [0,0,0,1],
        colorEnd: [234,0,255,1],
        gradient: 'vertical'
    }
});
```

Note that the container object will need to have a position style defined, as we use absolute position of the canvas which draw the back, without a position on the container the canvas could go outside.
And if you want something to be shown in front of the 3D background, you might also need to add a z-index on it.

Plus if you need specific options, we are open to it. Send us an email to support@naker.io
